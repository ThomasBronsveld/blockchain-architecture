## Setting up the network

This part of the repository constructs all the needed files and folders for the blockchain network. 

Because we have the network online in a cloud environment, you won't have to do anything. 

However, if you want to run it locally you will have to do the following steps: 

1. run `./generate.sh` in your terminal

2. to start the network run `./start.sh` you might have to sudo it depending on your OS. 

3. To bring the network down run: `./down.sh`

4. After this we go to the chaincode directory and follow the instructions there.
