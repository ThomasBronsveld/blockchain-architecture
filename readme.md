# Blockchain Architecture

This repository contains our solution for the course Blockchain Architecture. 

The goal of this course was to setup our own working Hyperledger Fabric network and connection
with it through a REST-API.

Our blockchain architecture consists of the following components: 
 
Our [own]() [Hyperledger Fabric network]()

Our [rest-api]()

Our [front-end]()

The [chaincode]()

## Setup

Because this repository consists of a lot of components, we've included in each component
its guiding readme.md. Links for these can be found in the list above. 

## Documentation

For this course we were also required to provide documentation. This documentation can be found
[here](https://github.com/ThomasBronsveld/blockchain-architecture/blob/master/documentation/README.md)
